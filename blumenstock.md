--------------------------------------------------Notes--------------------------------------------------


-Technology can create solutions to problems with speed and accuracy


-------------------------Pitfalls-------------------------


-Many researches disregard the human needs in search of data-related answers
-Phone usage can tell a lot about people in a certain area, especially when it comes to finding out who needs aid and who doesn't
-Instead of helping those in need, those who hold the resources to find the data/use it are in power or don't use it for the benefit of others
-Lots of online loans are made in sub-Saharan Africa, but nobody can track whether or not they're being put to use to aid others or if they're leading to more unnecessary debt
-It's easier for technology to be used in negative ways in places with weaker social institutions
-Flaws in new approaches to data collection are not thoroughly researched/well-understood yet compared to conventional tactics
-Accuracy of maps generated by computers can degrade quickly since relationships between variables could change over time
-"Globally, the most disadvantaged people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data."
-Lack of regulation to keep corruption out of data usage/spreading, especially in developing nations, can lead to businesses who only care about maximizing profits to not use the data for good


-------------------------Ways Forward-------------------------


-New sources of data can be benchmarked using older ones so that they complement each other instead of replacing one another
-Data needs to be able to help those who don't understand how things like loans or other first-world problems work, and everyday algorithms we use now can be adjusted to do that
-Algorithms need to be developed by those who actually have an understanding of the issue instead of those who solely understand the code and take on these projects on the side to earn more profits
-Fostering collaboration between many different parties that could help ("data scientists, development experts, governments, civil society, and the private sector â€” and especially with people and organizations in the country in question") will help
