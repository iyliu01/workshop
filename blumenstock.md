When it comes to acquiring and using data, information is usually put in the hands of the somewhat wealthy and privileged. Because of this phenomenon, data scientists trying to find solutions to problems in third-world countries or environments they aren't familiar with won't be able to help to the fullest extent since they have no firsthand experience in many of the situations they are trying to solve. Wanting to help but not being pressed to and knowing exactly what people need and having a true understanding of an issue are two very different things, especially when people's lives are at stake. Transparency and fostering connections between those in power, those who have the ability to solve an issue with technology or data, those who are finding ways to physically help, and those actually facing the problem will make solving these issues a lot more efficent. If scientists and data scientists make any information they discover readily available to the public for use and have people help interpret it and put it to use while those in need make their problems and necessary solutions known, many more issues can be solved, so I agree with the fact that transparency can help both sides of an issue.

In a perfect world, those who are able to process and find data would put their findings to good use. Unfortunately, a lot of larger companies or those in less developed countries who hold the most power might use this data for personal profit instead of for the greater good. This causes a lot of issues to remain unsolved since even though the data or solutions might be there and ready to use, they'll be used for more selfish reasons. Another issue in developing countries is the representation of its people to data scientists looking at statistics from behind a screen. In the article, Blumenstock mentioned that, "Globally, the most disadvantaged people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data" (Blumenstock 172). Those with less privilege and no access to any kind of technology might be a majority of the population in a certain country or area, but those with power and access to technology can be mistaken as representative of that area. This issue is easier to solve, however, as data scientists strive to do more thorough and inclusive research to give those in poverty or with less advantages more aid.
